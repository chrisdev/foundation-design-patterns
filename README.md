Design Patterns for pinax-theme-foundation
==========================================

This  is a demo and sample code site for [pinax-theme-foundation](https://github.com/chrisdev/pinax-theme-foundation/) 
A pinax theme is a reusable app that provides a set of Django templates for your apps along 
with complementary CSS and Javascript files that provide UX and design infrastructure for your site.  
This theme is based on [Zurb foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) a very light weigh, includes a 12 column responsive grid,
navigation tabs, buttons, typography and so on.  [Foundation](http://github.com/zurb/foundation)  is not as
feature complete as [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) indeed one of design goals of the project to

You can read more about the philosophy behind [Foundation](http://github.com/zurb/foundation) well as how to use it for rapid prototyping  [here](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dive-into-responsive-prototyping-with-foundation). 

This site provides examples which illustrate the use of

* A top navigation bar that is not part core [Foundation](http://github.com/zurb/foundation) but is required by many sites
* A set responsive design patterns originally discussed by [Joshnua Johson](http://designshack.net/articles/css/5-really-useful-responsive-web-design-patterns/)  but actually implement in [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) by [Matt Reimer](http://www.raisedeyebrow.com/blog/2012/04/responsive-design-patterns). 
* These provide a set of layout interaction patterns for responding to changes in the resolution and display characteristics of the device that is displaying the site namely
	* [Basic Gallery](http://apps.raisedeyebrow.com/Design_Patterns/basic_gallery.php)
	* [Column Flip](http://apps.raisedeyebrow.com/Design_Patterns/column_flip.php)
	* [Feature Shuffle](http://apps.raisedeyebrow.com/Design_Patterns/feature_shuffle.php)
	* [Mondarian](http://apps.raisedeyebrow.com/Design_Patterns/mondrian.php)
* [Foundation Icon Font Sets](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-icons)
