<h2>Responsive Design Patterns</h2>

<p>In a blog post written by a blog post by Joshua Johnson about responsive design patterns he wrote the following.</p>

<p>Responsive web design requires a very different way of thinking about layout that is both challenging and exciting. The art of layout was already complex enough for the centuries that it was defined by fixed elements, now things are becoming exponentially more complicated as layouts become increasingly adaptive. In Pinax theme Foundation we have taken some interesting responsive design patterns that are being implemented by talented designers all over the web and implemented them using Foundation so you can see the versatility of Pinax theme Foundation.</p>

<p>The mockups work at the following resolutions so take your browser window and make it these various sizes to see the magic.</p>

<p>Greater than <strong>980px</strong> wide <strong>(PC)</strong>
Between <strong>768px</strong> and <strong>980px (tablet-y)</strong>
Less than <strong>768px (phone-ish)</strong></p>
