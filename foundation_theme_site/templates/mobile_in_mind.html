<h2>Mobile Visibility</h2>

<p>By using Foundation 2.0 we've included various mobile visibility affordance classes. Want to hide something on phones, or show it only on tablets? Got you covered.</p>

<p>For example, the following text should describe the device you're using:<br/>
<strong>You are on a desktop machine.</strong></br/>
That example uses the 'show-on-x' classes seen here:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2655685.js"> </script>

<p>This example uses the opposite rules, so the following text should describe the device you're using:</br/>
<strong>You are not on a tablet device.</strong></br/>
<strong>You are not on a smartphone like an iPhone or Android phone.</strong></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2655690.js"> </script>

<p>Each of these classes have an implied 'only' as in 'show <em>only</em> on tablet' or 'hide <em>only</em> on phones'.</p>
