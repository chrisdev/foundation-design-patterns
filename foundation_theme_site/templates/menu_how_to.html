<h1>Drop-down Menu</h1>

<p>Anyone who has created drop-down menus will be familiar with the large quantities of scripting such menus typically require. 
But, in this Pinax theme foundation we have done all of the work for you allowing you to focus on the more important part of the design. 
This allows you to create visually appealing drop-downs that are easy to edit and update, and that work across a multitude of 
browsers, including Internet Explorer. Better still, for code-wary designers, no JavaScript is required! (Actually, some
 JavaScript is needed, but we already wrote it for you.)</p>

<h5> Location of the Menu</h5>
To create a drop-down menu the code must be placed within the top-bar and attached div classes. Out of the box Pinax Theme Foundation 
comes with one drop-down menu within the top-bar and attached div classes. To add another drop-down menu place the code below within the top-bar and attached div classes.
<h5>Creating the menu</h5>
<p>The first step is to create the menu structure itself. This is done by using an unordered list as the main menu bar, and each drop-down-menu appearing 
as a list within its parent list item. Sound complicated? Itâ€™s actually very straightforward: </p>

The above code shows the drop-down menu code for "design patterns". It should be noted that the design pattern was added 
as a list item that contained a list of links.  All that is required to define a dropdown menu in the topbar is to make
a list item tag with css class "has-dropdown" and a unordered list tag with css class "dropdown"
