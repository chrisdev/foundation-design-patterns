</ul>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>Create a virtual environment for your project and activate it::</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2639952.js"> </script>

<p>Next install Pinax::</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/2639920.js"> </script>
	
<p>Once Pinax is installed use <strong>pinax-admin</strong>  to create a project for your site::</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/2639930.js"> </script>

<p>The example above will create a starter django project in the mysite folder based on the Pinax <strong>basic</strong> project. Of ccourse you can use any of the Pinax starter Projects.  The <strong>basic</strong> project provides features such as 
basic account management as well as user profiles and notifications. The project also comes with a theme - a collection css, javascript files and default templates based on Twitter Bootstrap. </p>

<p>To use the <strong>zurb-foundation</strong> theme in the project, include "pinax-theme-foundation" in requirements/project.txt. Edit the <strong>settings.py</strong> file and 
comment out the entry for "pinax<em>theme</em>bootstrap" and add "pinax<em>theme</em>foundation" in your INSTALLED APPS::</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2640077.js"> </script>

<p>Inside your project run::</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2640084.js"> </script>

<p>Change the Site name by editing <em>fixture/initial_data.json</em>  you can also use the Admin app for this purpose. </p>

<p>Your "site<em>base.html" should extend "theme</em>base.html" and should provide "footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).</p>

<p>Your pages should have blocks "head<em>title" and "body" and should extend "site</em>base.html".</p>

<p>The <strong>url</strong> name "home" should be defined as the homepage.</p>

<p>Foundation is 100% responsive so that you may want to add the following to the project style sheet <em>static/site_sytles.css</em>
to handle larger displays::</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2640103.js"> </script>

the markup expected by foundation</p>
